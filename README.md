# machine-learning-model
â€¢	Considering the two data files attached to this homework assignment. This data is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains biomechanical features of some patients. The task is to predict whether the patient is normal or abnormal (call it Data2). The second dataset splits the abnormal group into two different diagnoses (call it Data3). Both datasets have same 310 feature vectors, six features, and a class column. 
The task is to create a machine learning model and perform multiple activitied with decision trees in matlab using fitctree.
